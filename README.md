In the digital age, effective web marketing strategies are crucial for business success. Understanding how users interact with your
online presence and how your marketing efforts translate into tangible outcomes is key. This project introduces a comprehensive
Power BI dashboard designed specifically for Web Marketing Analysis, aiming to bridge the gap between data collection and 
actionable insights.

##Objective of the Dashboard:
The primary objective of this dashboard is to provide a holistic view of web marketing performance through key performance
